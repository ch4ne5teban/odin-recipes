    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Have some balls? I mean fried ones of a bull, calf or a pig? "Criadillas" are fried testicles - a delitrocity commonplace in bull-fighting countries like Spain, Argentina, and Mexico. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bulls testicles 500g</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves 5</li> 
        <li>Egg 1</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs 60g</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Filet the criadillas using a sharp knife. Remove the skin and cut each testicle into 4, length-ways.</li>
        <li>Bring a salted large pot of water to the boil and place the criadillas into the pot. Cover and leave to simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whilst your criadillas are cooking, in a separate bowl combine the breadcrumbs with garlic, thyme, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper and mix well.</li>
        <li>Remove the criadillas from the pan and pat dry, leaving for around 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a frying pan with enough oil to shallow fry and pre-heat.</li>
        <li>Crack an egg in to a separate bowl and whisk briefly. Now dip each of your criadillas into the egg and then into the breadcrumb mix.</li>
        <li>Once they are all coated, pop them into the frying pan for around 3 minutes or until they float to the surface.</li>
        <li>Take them out of the pan and serve with salsa.</li>
    </ol>
